XION Arcade WEMO-Enabled Control Panel
================================================================================

This is an iPad application designed for remote control of XION Arcade devices.
The app is designed for XION but could work with any WEMO-enabled household by
changing only one line of code.

The control panel is powered by the server-side client application called
[Ouimeaux](http://ouimeaux.readthedocs.org). The application talks to any
Ouimeaux server instance that is running and uses this to retrieve device
information and to toggle devices on the network.
